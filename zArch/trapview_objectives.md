# Objectives, Trapview data
 1. ***Characterize data sets***
    - How many observations per trap?
    - Start and stop dates -- gaps?
    - Time intervals for each trap
	- Temperature profile -- how much variation each year?
    - Other relevant factors (lure changes, change in body design)
 2. ***Obtain seasonal profiles for the 2019 and 2020 traps***
    - Moths per week for each trap*year
 3. ***Examine relationships***
    - Proportion of total daily capture by hour (shift day back to "start at 
	sunset"?)
	- Compare an appropriate metric (first capture or 25th percentile) with a 
	suitable temperature metric (temperature at sunset, temperature at midnight,
	or temperature at time of first capture)
	- Examine day-to-day variation in total capture
