# Approach to TrapView data

## 1) Identify times and places with quality data

Addressed sufficiently for present with "mdown1_input_data.pdf" and mdown2_x.pdf

## 2) Clean and characterize data

### Count data
 - Examine data for which there is a large pest_diff with an equal pest_nmbr
 - Examine when and where daytime fliers occur (defined and 6AM to 6PM). 
 - Determine when and where early night fliers occur. Are they sufficiently
 unusual that we can keep examination from midnight to midnight?

### Temperature data

Note that temperature data is hourly. This could be a limiting factor

## 3) Examination of data with large count numbers
 - select days with large count numbers
 - bin counts by hour for these days
 - Examine how widely or narrowly counts are distributed by times
 - Examine variation of time of first capture (important in own right)
 - bin low_temp by hour
 - examine temperature at time of first capture (most important)
